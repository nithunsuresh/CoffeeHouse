                    Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine, a mild drug that keeps people awake.
                     To make a drink from coffee beans, the beans must first be specially prepared by drying the beans and then roasting. The beans are dried a short time after they are picked. 
                     This preserves them and makes them ready to be packed or roasted.</p>

        <div class="start">
            <p>In this article, we will introduce and identify characteristics of the four main types of coffee beans currently in commercial circulation: Arabica, Robusta, and the less common Liberica and Excelsa coffee beans.</p>

           <ul>
            <li>Liberica Coffee Beans </li><p>Native to central and western Africa – specifically Liberia, hence its name – Coffea liberica is prized for its piquant floral aroma and bold, smoky flavor profile. This hardy species is frequently mixed with other varieties to add body and complexity, but rarely receives any credit. Unheard of in Western civilization before the late 1800s, Liberica gained a foothold with Southeast Asian coffee producers after a fungal disease (“coffee rust”) wiped out much of the region’s Arabica crops.

                Growing from a much larger plant than Arabica or Robusta, most Liberica cherries tend to be irregular in shape and closer to Robusta in size and general appearance. It’s also tolerant of hot, humid climates and does well at low altitude. Now produced mainly in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, the bean makes up roughly 2% of the world’s coffee supply. Over 95% percent of the Malaysian coffee yield is Liberica beans. However, it’s not commonly found in North American and European markets.
                
                </p>
            <li>Robusta Coffee Bean</li><p>The second most popular type of coffee bean is Robusta. This bean originated in sub-Saharan Africa and is now grown primarily in Africa and Indonesia. It’s also particularly popular in Vietnam and is often mixed into coffee blends. It’s a less expensive variety, making it a very budget-friendly choice for roasters.Robusta beans are larger and more rounded than the other bean varieties. These plants typically grow much larger than Arabica plants, measuring between 15 and 20 feet. Robusta beans are typically considered to be hardier because they can grow at lower altitudes and resist diseases. But recent research suggests that they don’t handle heat as well as was previously thought.</p>

            <li>Arabic-</li><p>You’re probably already familiar with this commonly produced coffee bean; it accounts for over 60% of the world’s coffee production. Arabica beans are grown at high altitudes, in areas that receive steady rainfall and have a plentiful amount of shade. Arabica trees are generally easy to care for as they are relatively small and easy to prune—they are normally no taller than 6′; their small stature also makes harvesting simpler.

                Arabica is the most delicate of the 4 . It is easily influenced by its environment and prone to disease. It must be farmed with great care. When Arabica plants are grown in climates where they do not naturally thrive, it can take double the effort to keep them healthy. Since it is one of the more popular beans, Arabica is often grown in large quantities (called “monoculture”)—however, this has the potential for disaster. Growing the disease-prone Arabica plants in large groups makes the trees more susceptible to a massive outbreak of disease, such as blight, that will inevitably contaminate the entire crop. If one Arabica plant goes, there’s a solid chance a large portion of the crop is going with it.</p>

                <p>Starbucks was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle's Pike Place Market. During the early 1980s, they sold the company to Howard Schultz who – after a business trip to Milan, Italy – decided to convert the coffee bean store into a coffee shop serving espresso-based drinks. As chief executive officer from 1986 to 2000, Schultz's first tenure led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the West Coast of the United States. Schultz was succeeded by Orin Smith who ran the company for five years and positioned Starbucks as a large player in fair trade coffee, increasing sales to US$5 billion. Jim Donald served as chief executive officer from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale earnings expansion. Schultz returned as CEO during the financial crisis of 2007–08 and spent the succeeding decade growing the company's market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting the brand around corporate social responsibility. Kevin Johnson succeeded Schultz as CEO in 2017. In March 2022, Starbucks announced that Schultz would return as CEO in April 2022 in an interim role.[4] Later that September, Laxman Narasimhan was appointed to succeed him in April 2023, with Schultz remaining a member of the Board of Directors. Narasimhan assumed the position sooner than planned, in March 2023.[5]</p>

                <p>Dunkin' Donuts LLC,[1] also known as Dunkin'[n 1] and by the initials DD, is an American multinational coffee and doughnut company, as well as a quick service restaurant. It was founded by Bill Rosenberg (1916–2002) in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1950. The chain was acquired by Baskin-Robbins's holding company Allied Lyons in 1990; its acquisition of the Mister Donut chain and the conversion of that chain to Dunkin' Donuts facilitated the brand's growth in North America that year.[5] Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins eventually became subsidiaries of Dunkin' Brands, headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, in 2004, until being purchased by Inspire Brands on December 15, 2020. The chain began rebranding as a "beverage-led company", and was renamed Dunkin', in January 2019; while stores in the U.S. began using the new name, the rebranding will eventually be rolled out to all of its international stores.[6]

                    With approximately 12,900 locations in 42 countries, Dunkin' is one of the largest coffee shop and donut shop chains in the world.[7][8] Its products include donuts, bagels, coffee, and "Munchkins" donut holes.[9][10]</p>
